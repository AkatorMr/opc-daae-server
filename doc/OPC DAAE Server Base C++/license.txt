<p>The licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The
licensed Software is licensed, not sold. Technosoftware shall own all right, title and interest including the intellectual property rights in and to the
information on bug fixes or error corrections relating to the licensed Software that are submitted by Licensee to Technosoftware as well as any intellectual
property rights to the correction of any errors, if any.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE. BY INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE, LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LICENSEE HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS
THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE THE DATE UPON THE SOFTWARE WAS FIRST DELIVERED

<p>IF LICENSEE DOES NOT ACCEPT THESE LICENSE TERMS, THEN TECHNOSOFTWARE DOES NOT GRANT ANY LICENSE TO THE SOFTWARE, AND LICENSEE MUST NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL
THE SOFTWARE.</p>

<p>TECHNOSOFTWARE provides different licenses depending on the component and on the ownership of a purchased license of the user of the sources. A single ZIP
file or a single repository can contain multiple components where the sources have different license models. The valid license is in the header of each source
file.</p>

<p>Following are basic rules on how TECHNOSOFTWARE licenses the different components:</p>

<p>1. OPC DA/AE/HDA and OPC UA core components follow a dual-license model:<br />
&nbsp; - Owner of a purchased license:&nbsp;<a href="https://technosoftware.com/license/RPLv15License.txt">RPL 1.5</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enables Owner of a purchased license to deploy their applications using the core component sources without being required to disclose the
application code.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; - Users that are not Owner of a purchased license:&nbsp;<a href="https://technosoftware.com/license/GPLv3License.txt">GPL 3.0</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the GPL 3.0 license terms these users must disclose their application code when using the core component sources.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Samples and Utilities:</p>

<p>&nbsp; - All samples and most of the utilities are provided under the [<a href="https://technosoftware.com/license/MITLicense.txt">MIT</a>]&nbsp;license for
everyone.<br /></p>
